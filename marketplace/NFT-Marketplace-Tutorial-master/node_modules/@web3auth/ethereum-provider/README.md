> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Web3Auth Ethereum Provider can be used to interact with wallet or connected EVM compatible chain using RPC calls. This is an EIP-1193 compatible JRPC provider. This package exposes a class `EthereumPrivateKeyProvider`, which accepts a `secp251k1` private key and returns `EIP1193` compatible provider, which can be used with various wallet sdks.
