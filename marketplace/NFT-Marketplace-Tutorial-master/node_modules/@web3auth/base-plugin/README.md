> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Plugins are essentially extensions to the core functionality of Web3Auth, allowing you to add additional features to your dApp. This base plugin is the base implementation of a plugin, and is the foundation of all other plugins.
