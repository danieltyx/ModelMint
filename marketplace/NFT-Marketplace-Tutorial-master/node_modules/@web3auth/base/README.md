> Web3Auth is where passwordless auth meets non-custodial key infrastructure for Web3 apps and wallets. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets and innovative Multi Party Computation (MPC) - Web3Auth provides a seamless login experience to every user on your application.

Web3Auth Base contains the basic typescript types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.
